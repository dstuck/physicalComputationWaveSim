This project was from the last day of the Physical Computation workshop Calder put on for the New Orleans Game Dev group on 1/16/2025.

We used a Ultrasonic Distance Sensor hooked up to an Arduino Nano that has the (physcomptest.ino) file loaded onto it via the Arduino IDE.

You can play the demo without it by just using up and down to control the wave level instead.
